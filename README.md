# qrcode

A Very simple python code to generate qrCode from a text file, with each pattern on a new line on the file inputData.txt(sammple five line intially).

I do this following a challange I face on most of the online qrcode genrators limitation for only 10 bulk generation of qrcode, at that time I need 1k.
